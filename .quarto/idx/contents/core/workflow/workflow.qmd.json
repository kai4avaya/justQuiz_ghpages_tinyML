Commonly referred to as the machine learning lifecycle](images/png/ML_life_cycle.png){#fig-ml-life-cycle}\n\n@fig-ml-life-cycle illustrates the systematic workflow required for developing a successful machine learning model. This end-to-end process, commonly referred to as the machine learning lifecycle, enables you to build, deploy, and maintain models effectively. It typically involves the following key steps:\n\n1. **Problem Definition** - Start by clearly articulating the specific problem you want to solve. This focuses on your efforts during data collection and model building.\n2. **Data Collection and Preparation:** Gather relevant, high-quality training data that captures all aspects of the problem. Clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for modeling.\n3. **Model Selection and Training:** Choose a machine learning algorithm suited to your problem type and data. Consider the pros and cons of different approaches. Feed the prepared data into the model to train it. Training time varies based on data size and model complexity.\n4. **Model Evaluation:** Test the trained model on new unseen data to measure its predictive accuracy. Identify any limitations.\n6. **Model Deployment:** Integrate the validated model into applications or systems to start operationalization.\n7. **Monitor and Maintain:** Track model performance in production. Retrain periodically on new data to keep it current.\n\nFollowing this structured ML workflow helps guide you through the key phases of development. It ensures you build effective and robust models ready for real-world deployment, resulting in higher-quality models that solve your business needs.\n\nThe ML workflow is iterative, requiring ongoing monitoring and potential adjustments. Additional considerations include:\n\n* **Version Control:** Track code and data changes to reproduce results and revert to earlier versions if needed.\n* **Documentation:** Maintain detailed documentation for workflow understanding and reproduction.\n* **Testing:** Rigorously test the workflow to ensure its functionality.\n* **Security:** Safeguard your workflow and data when deploying models in production settings.\n\n## Traditional vs. Embedded AI\n\nThe ML workflow is a universal guide applicable across various platforms, including cloud-based solutions, edge computing, and TinyML. However, the workflow for Embedded AI introduces unique complexities and challenges, making it a captivating domain and paving the way for remarkable innovations. @fig-dl-and-ml illustrates the differences between Machine Learning and Deep Learning.\n\n![Comparing traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

Techniques like model quantization and pruning are crucial.\n\n### Real-time Processing\n\n* **Traditional ML Workflow:** Less emphasis on real-time processing, often relying on batch data processing.\n* **Embedded AI Workflow:** Prioritizes real-time data processing, making low latency and quick execution essential, especially in applications like autonomous vehicles and industrial automation.\n\n### Data Management and Privacy\n\n* **Traditional ML Workflow:** Processes data in centralized locations, often necessitating extensive data transfer and focusing on data security during transit and storage.\n* **Embedded AI Workflow:** This workflow leverages edge computing to process data closer to its source, reducing data transmission and enhancing privacy through data localization.\n\n### Hardware-Software Integration\n\n* **Traditional ML Workflow:** Typically operates on general-purpose hardware, with software development occurring independently.\n* **Embedded AI Workflow:** This workflow involves a more integrated approach to hardware and software development, often incorporating custom chips or hardware accelerators to achieve optimal performance.\n\n## Roles & Responsibilities\n\nCreating an ML solution, especially for embedded AI, is a multidisciplinary effort involving various specialists. Unlike traditional software development, building an ML solution demands a multidisciplinary approach due to the experimental nature of model development and the resource-intensive requirements of training and deploying these models.\n\nThere is a pronounced need for roles focusing on data for the success of machine learning pipelines. Data scientists and data engineers handle data collection, build data pipelines, and ensure data quality. Since the nature of machine learning models depends on the data they consume, the models are unique and vary with different applications, necessitating extensive experimentation. Machine learning researchers and engineers drive this experimental phase through continuous testing, validation, and iteration to achieve optimal performance.\n\nThe deployment phase often requires specialized hardware and infrastructure, as machine learning models can be resource-intensive, demanding high computational power and efficient resource management. This necessitates collaboration with hardware engineers to ensure that the infrastructure can support the computational demands of model training and inference.\n\nAs models make decisions that can impact individuals and society, ethical and legal aspects of machine learning are becoming increasingly important. Ethicists and legal advisors are needed to ensure compliance with ethical standards and legal regulations.\n\nUnderstanding the various roles involved in an ML project is crucial for its successful completion. @tbl-mlops_roles provides a general overview of these typical roles, although it's important to note that the lines between them can sometimes blur.
