It is the core software that runs on a computer, acting as an intermediary between hardware and application software. The OS manages the computer's memory, processes, device drivers, files, and security protocols.\n\n1. **Key functions**:\n   - Process management: Allocating CPU time to different programs\n   - Memory management: Allocating and freeing up memory as needed\n   - File system management: Organizing and keeping track of files and directories\n   - Device management: Communicating with connected hardware devices\n   - User interface: Providing a way for users to interact with the computer\n2. **Components**:\n   - Kernel: The core of the OS that manages hardware resources\n   - Shell: The user interface for interacting with the OS\n   - File system: Organizes and manages data storage\n   - Device drivers: Software that allows the OS to communicate with hardware\n\nThe Raspberry Pi runs a specialized version of Linux designed for embedded systems. This operating system, typically a variant of Debian called Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian), is optimized for the Pi's ARM-based architecture and limited resources.\n\n> The latest version of Raspberry Pi OS is based on [Debian Bookworm](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/bookworm-the-new-version-of-raspberry-pi-os/). \n\n**Key features**:\n\n1. Lightweight: Tailored to run efficiently on the Pi's hardware.\n2. Versatile: Supports a wide range of applications and programming languages.\n3. Open-source: Allows for customization and community-driven improvements.\n4. GPIO support: Enables interaction with sensors and other hardware through the Pi's pins.\n5. Regular updates: Continuously improved for performance and security.\n\nEmbedded Linux on the Raspberry Pi provides a full-featured operating system in a compact package, making it ideal for projects ranging from simple IoT devices to more complex edge machine-learning applications. Its compatibility with standard Linux tools and libraries makes it a powerful platform for development and experimentation.\n\n### Installation\n\nTo use the Raspberry Pi, we will need an operating system. By default, Raspberry Pi checks for an operating system on any SD card inserted in the slot, so we should install an operating system using [Raspberry Pi Imager.](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)\n\n*Raspberry Pi Imager* is a tool for downloading and writing images on *macOS*, *Windows*, and *Linux*. It includes many popular operating system images for Raspberry Pi. We will also use the Imager to preconfigure credentials and remote access settings.\n\nFollow the steps to install the OS in your Raspi.\n\n1. [Download](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and install the Raspberry Pi Imager on your computer.\n2. Insert a microSD card into your computer (a 32GB SD card is recommended) .\n3. Open Raspberry Pi Imager and select your Raspberry Pi model.\n4. Choose the appropriate operating system:\n   - **For Raspi-Zero**: For example, you can select:\n     `Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)`. \n   \n   ![img](images/png/zero-burn.png)\n   \n   > Due to its reduced SDRAM (512MB), the recommended OS for the Raspi-Zero is the 32-bit version. However, to run some machine learning models, such as the YOLOv8 from Ultralitics, we should use the 64-bit version. Although Raspi-Zero can run a *desktop*, we will choose the LITE version (no Desktop) to reduce the RAM needed for regular operation.\n   \n   - For **Raspi-5**: We can select the full 64-bit version, which includes a desktop:\n     `Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)`\n   \n   ![](images/png/r5-burn.png)\n5. Select your microSD card as the storage device.\n6. Click on `Next` and then the `gear` icon to access advanced options.\n7. Set the *hostname*, the Raspi *username and password*, configure *WiFi* and *enable SSH* (Very important!)\n\n![](images/jpeg/setup.jpg)\n\n8. Write the image to the microSD card.\n\n> In the examples here, we will use different hostnames depending on the device used: raspi, raspi-5, raspi-Zero, etc. It would help if you replaced it with the one you are using. \n\n### Initial Configuration\n\n1. Insert the microSD card into your Raspberry Pi.\n2. Connect power to boot up the Raspberry Pi.\n3. Please wait for the initial boot process to complete (it may take a few minutes).\n\n> You can find the most common Linux commands to be used with the Raspi [here](https://www.jwdittrich.people.ysu.edu/raspberrypi/UsefulRaspberryPiCommands.pdf) or [here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-raspberry-pi/modules/raspberry-pi-command-line-module/cheatsheet).\n\n## Remote Access\n\n### SSH Access\n\nThe easiest way to interact with the Raspi-Zero is via SSH (\"Headless\"). You can use a Terminal (MAC/Linux),  [PuTTy (](https://www.putty.org/)Windows), or any other.\n\n1. Find your Raspberry Pi's IP address (for example, check your router).\n\n2. On your computer, open a terminal and connect via SSH:\n   ```bash\n   ssh username@[raspberry_pi_ip_address]   \n   ```\n   Alternatively, if you do not have the IP address, you can try the following:\n    ```bash\n   ssh username@hostname.local   \n    ```\n    for example, `ssh mjrovai@rpi-5.local` , `ssh mjrovai@raspi.local` , etc.\n   \n   ![img](images/png/ssh.png)\n   \n   When you see the prompt:\n   \n   ```bash\n   mjrovai@rpi-5:~ $\n   ```\n   \n   It means that you are interacting remotely with your Raspi.\n   It is a good practice to update/upgrade the system regularly. For that, you should run:\n   \n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt upgrade\n   ```\n   You should confirm the Raspi IP address. On the terminal, you can use:\n   ```bash\n   hostname -I\n   ```\n\n![](images/png/pasted_graphic_11_ILcmyOYU7X.png)\n\n\n### To shut down the Raspi via terminal:\n\nWhen you want to turn off your Raspberry Pi, there are better ideas than just pulling the power cord. This is because the Raspi may still be writing data to the SD card, in which case merely powering down may result in data loss or, even worse, a corrupted SD card.\n\nFor safety shut down, use the command line:\n\n```bash\nsudo shutdown -h now\n```\n\n> To avoid possible data loss and SD card corruption, before removing the power, you should wait a few seconds after shutdown for the Raspberry Pi's LED to stop blinking and go dark. Once the LED goes out, it's safe to power down.\n\n###  Transfer Files between the Raspi and a computer\n\nTransferring files between the Raspi and our main computer can be done using a pen drive, directly on the terminal (with scp), or an FTP program over the network. \n\n#### Using Secure Copy Protocol (`scp`):\n\n##### Copy files to your Raspberry Pi\n\nLet's create a text file on our computer, for example, `test.txt`. \n\n![](images/png/test_txt.png)\n\n> You can use any text editor. In the same terminal, an option is the `nano`. \n\nTo copy the file named `test.txt` from your personal computer to a user's home folder on your Raspberry Pi, run the following command from the directory containing `test.txt`, replacing the `<username>` placeholder with the username you use to log in to your Raspberry Pi and the `<pi_ip_address>` placeholder with your Raspberry Pi's IP address:\n\n```bash\n$ scp test.txt <username>@<pi_ip_address>:~/\n```\n\n> Note that `~/`  means that we will move the file to the ROOT of our Raspi. You can choose any folder in your Raspi. But you should create the folder before you run `scp`, since `scp` won't create folders automatically. \n\nFor example, let's transfer the file `test.txt`  to the ROOT of my Raspi-zero, which has an IP of `192.168.4.210`:\n\n```bash\nscp test.txt mjrovai@192.168.4.210:~/\n```\n\n![](images/png/transfer_file.png)\n\nI use a different profile to differentiate the terminals. The above action happens **on your computer**. Now, let's go to our Raspi (using the SSH) and check if the file is there:\n\n![](images/png/list_archives.png)\n\n##### Copy files from your Raspberry Pi\n\nTo copy a file named `test.txt` from a user's home directory on a Raspberry Pi to the current directory on another computer, run the following command **on your Host Computer**:\n\n```bash\n$ scp <username>@<pi_ip_address>:myfile.txt .\n```\n\nFor example:\n\nOn the Raspi, let's create a copy of the file with another name:\n\n```bash\ncp test.txt test_2.txt\n```\n\nAnd on the Host Computer (in my case, a Mac)\n\n```bash\nscp mjrovai@192.168.4.210:test_2.txt .\n```\n\n![](images/png/tranfer-text-mac.png)\n\n#### Transferring files using FTP\n\nTransferring files using FTP, such as [FileZilla FTP Client](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client), is also possible. Follow the instructions, install the program for your Desktop OS, and use the Raspi IP address as the `Host`. For example:\n\n```bash\nsftp://192.168.4.210\n```\n\nand enter your Raspi `username and password`. Pressing `Quickconnect` will open two windows, one for your host computer desktop (right) and another for the Raspi (left).\n\n![](images/png/filezila.png)\n\n## Increasing SWAP Memory\n\nUsing `htop`, a cross-platform interactive process viewer, you can easily monitor the resources running on your Raspi, such as the list of processes, the running CPUs, and the memory used in real-time.  To lunch `hop`, enter with the command on the terminal:\n\n```bash\nhtop\n```\n\n![](images/png/htop.png)\n\nRegarding memory, among the devices in the Raspberry Pi family, the Raspi-Zero has the smallest amount of SRAM (500MB), compared to a selection of 2GB to 8GB on the Raspis 4 or 5. For any Raspi, it is possible to increase the memory available to the system with \"Swap.\" Swap memory, also known as swap space, is a technique used in computer operating systems to temporarily store data from RAM (Random Access Memory) on the SD card when the physical RAM is fully utilized. This allows the operating system (OS) to continue running even when RAM is full, which can prevent system crashes or slowdowns.\n\nSwap memory benefits devices with limited RAM, such as the Raspi-Zero. Increasing swap can help run more demanding applications or processes, but it's essential to balance this with the potential performance impact of frequent disk access.\n\nBy default, the Rapi-Zero's SWAP (Swp) memory is only 100MB, which is very small for running some more complex and demanding Machine Learning applications (for example, YOLO). Let's increase it to 2MB:\n\nFirst, turn off swap-file:\n\n```bash\nsudo dphys-swapfile swapoff\n```\n\nNext, you should open and change the file `/etc/dphys-swapfile`. For that, we will use the nano:\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile\n```\n\nSearch for the **CONF_SWAPSIZE** variable (default is 200) and update it to **2000**:\n\n```bash\nCONF_SWAPSIZE=2000\n```\n\nAnd save the file.\n\nNext, turn on the swapfile again and reboot the Raspi-zero:\n\n```bash\nsudo dphys-swapfile setup\nsudo dphys-swapfile swapon\nsudo reboot\n```\n\nWhen your device is rebooted (you should enter with the SSH again), you will realize that the maximum swap memory value shown on top is now something near 2GB (in my case, 1.95GB).\n\n> To keep the *htop* running, you should open another terminal window to interact continuously with your Raspi.\n\n## Installing a Camera\n\nThe Raspi is an excellent device for computer vision applications; a camera is needed for it. We can install a standard USB webcam on the micro-USB port using a USB OTG adapter (Raspi-Zero and Raspi-5) or a camera module connected to the Raspi CSI (Camera Serial Interface) port. \n\n> USB Webcams generally have inferior quality to the camera modules that connect to the CSI port. They can also not be controlled using the `raspistill` and `raspivid` commands in the terminal or the `picamera` recording package in Python. Nevertheless, there may be reasons why you want to connect a USB camera to your Raspberry Pi, such as because of the benefit that it is much easier to set up multiple cameras with a single Raspberry Pi, long cables, or simply because you have such a camera on hand. \n\n### Installing a USB WebCam\n\n1. Power off the Raspi:\n\n```bash\nsudo shutdown -h no\n```\n\n2. Connect the USB Webcam (USB Camera Module 30fps,1280x720) to your Raspi (In this example, I am using the Raspi-Zero, but the instructions work for all Raspis). \n\n![](images/jpeg/usb-cam-2.jpg)\n\n\n\n3. Power on again and run the SSH\n3. To check if your USB camera is recognized, run:\n\n```bash\nlsusb\n```\n\nYou should see your camera listed in the output.\n\n![](images/png/USB-CAM-2.png)\n\n5. To take a test picture with your USB camera, use:\n\n```bash\nfswebcam test_image.jpg\n```\n\nThis will save an image named \"test_image.jpg\" in your current directory.\n\n![](images/png/image-test.png)\n\n6. Since we are using SSH to connect to our Rapsi, we must transfer the image to our main computer so we can view it. We can use FileZilla or SCP for this:\n\nOpen a terminal **on your host computer** and run:\n\n```bash\nscp mjrovai@raspi-zero.local:~/test_image.jpg .\n```\n\n> Replace \"mjrovai\" with your username and \"raspi-zero\" with Pi's hostname.\n\n![](images/png/cam-2_test.png)\n\n\n\n7. If the image quality isn't satisfactory, you can adjust various settings; for example, define a resolution that is suitable for YOLO (640x640):\n\n```bash\nfswebcam -r 640x640 --no-banner test_image_yolo.jpg\n```\n\nThis captures a higher-resolution image without the default banner.\n\n![](images/png/usb-cam-test-2.png)\n\nAn ordinary USB Webcam can also be used:\n\n![](images/jpeg/usb_camera.jpg)\n\nAnd verified using `lsusb`\n\n![](images/png/usb-cam-test.png)\n\n#### Video Streaming\n\nFor stream video (which is more resource-intensive), we can install and use mjpg-streamer:\n\nFirst, install Git:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install git\n```\n\nNow, we should install the necessary dependencies for mjpg-streamer, clone the repository, and proceed with the installation:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install cmake libjpeg62-turbo-dev\ngit clone https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer.git\ncd mjpg-streamer/mjpg-streamer-experimental\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n\nThen start the stream with:\n\n```bash\nmjpg_streamer -i \"input_uvc.so\" -o \"output_http.so -w ./www\"\n```\n\nWe can then access the stream by opening a web browser and navigating to: \n\n`http://<your_pi_ip_address>:8080`. In my case: http://192.168.4.210:8080\n\nWe should see a webpage with options to view the stream. Click on the link that says \"Stream\" or try accessing:\n\n```bash\nhttp://<raspberry_pi_ip_address>:8080/?action=stream\n```\n\n![](images/png/streem.png)\n\n### Installing a Camera Module on the CSI port\n\nThere are now several Raspberry Pi camera modules. The original 5-megapixel model was [released](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/camera-board-available-for-sale/) in 2013, followed by an [8-megapixel Camera Module 2](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-v2/) that was later released in 2016. The latest camera model is the [12-megapixel Camera Module 3](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html), released in 2023.\n\nThe original 5MP camera (**Arducam OV5647**) is no longer available from Raspberry Pi but can be found from several alternative suppliers. Below is an example of such a camera on a Raspi-Zero.\n\n![](images/jpeg/rasp-zero-with-cam.jpg)\n\nHere is another example of a v2 Camera Module, which has a **Sony IMX219** 8-megapixel sensor:\n\n![](images/png/raspi-5-cam.png)\n\nAny camera module will work on the Raspberry Pis, but for that, the `configuration.txt` file must be updated:\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt\n```\n\nAt the bottom of the file, for example, to use the 5MP Arducam OV5647 camera, add the line:\n\n```bash\ndtoverlay=ov5647,cam0\n```\n\nOr for the v2 module, wich has the 8MP Sony IMX219 camera:\n\n```bash\ndtoverlay=imx219,cam0\n```\n\nSave the file (CTRL+O [ENTER] CRTL+X) and reboot the Raspi:\n\n```bash\nSudo reboot\n```\n\nAfter the boot, you can see if the camera is listed:\n\n```bash\nlibcamera-hello --list-cameras\n```\n\n![](images/jpeg/list_cams_raspi-zero.jpg)\n\n![](images/png/list_cams_raspi-5.png)\n\n> [libcamera](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/camera_software.html#libcamera) is an open-source software library that supports camera systems directly from the Linux operating system on Arm processors. It minimizes proprietary code running on the Broadcom GPU.\n\nLet's capture a jpeg image with a resolution of 640 x 480 for testing and save it to a file named `test_cli_camera.jpg`\n\n```bash\nrpicam-jpeg --output test_cli_camera.jpg --width 640 --height 480\n```\n\nif we want to see the file saved, we should use `ls -f`, which lists all current directory content in long format. As before, we can use scp to view the image:\n\n![](images/png/test_camera_raspi-5.png)\n\n\n\n## Running the Raspi Desktop remotely\n\nWhile we've primarily interacted with the Raspberry Pi using terminal commands via SSH, we can access the whole graphical desktop environment remotely if we have installed the complete Raspberry Pi OS (for example, `Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)`. This can be particularly useful for tasks that benefit from a visual interface. To enable this functionality, we must set up a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) server on the Raspberry Pi. Here's how to do it:\n\n1. Enable the VNC Server:\n   - Connect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH.\n   - Run the Raspberry Pi configuration tool by entering:\n     ```bash\n     sudo raspi-config\n     ```\n   - Navigate to `Interface Options` using the arrow keys.\n\n   ![](images/png/vnc-1.png)\n\n   - Select `VNC` and `Yes` to enable the VNC server.\n\n   ![](images/png/vnc-2.png)\n\n   - Exit the configuration tool, saving changes when prompted.\n\n   ![](images/png/vnc-3.png)\n\n2. Install a VNC Viewer on Your Computer:\n   - Download and install a VNC viewer application on your main computer. Popular options include RealVNC Viewer, TightVNC, or VNC Viewer by RealVNC. We will install [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer) by RealVNC.\n\n3. Once installed, you should confirm the Raspi IP address. For example, on the terminal, you can use:\n\n   ```bash\n   hostname -I\n   ```\n\n   ![](images/png/vnc-4.png)\n\n4. Connect to Your Raspberry Pi:\n   - Open your VNC viewer application.\n   \n   ![](images/png/vnc-5.png)\n   \n   - Enter your Raspberry Pi's IP address and hostname.\n   - When prompted, enter your Raspberry Pi's username and password.\n   \n   ![](images/png/vnc-7.png)\n   \n5. The Raspberry Pi 5 Desktop should appear on your computer monitor.\n\n   ![](images/png/vnc-8.png)\n\n6. Adjust Display Settings (if needed):\n\n   - Once connected, adjust the display resolution for optimal viewing. This can be done through the Raspberry Pi's desktop settings or by modifying the config.txt file.\n   - Let's do it using the desktop settings. Reach the menu (the Raspberry Icon at the left upper corner) and select the best screen definition for your monitor:\n\n![](images/png/vnc-9.png)\n\n## Updating and Installing Software\n\n1. Update your system:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y\n   ```\n2. Install essential software:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt install python3-pip -y\n   ```\n3. Enable pip for Python projects:\n   ```bash\n   sudo rm /usr/lib/python3.11/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED\n   ```\n\n## Model-Specific Considerations\n\n### Raspberry Pi Zero (Raspi-Zero)\n\n- Limited processing power, best for lightweight projects\n- It is better to use a headless setup (SSH) to conserve resources.\n- Consider increasing swap space for memory-intensive tasks.\n- It can be used for Image Classification and Object Detection Labs but not for the LLM (SLM).\n\n### Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 (Raspi-4 or Raspi-5)\n\n- Suitable for more demanding projects, including AI and machine learning.\n- It can run the whole desktop environment smoothly.\n- Raspi-4 can be used for Image Classification and Object Detection Labs but will not work well with LLMs (SLM).\n- For Raspi-5, consider using an active cooler for temperature management during intensive tasks, as in the LLMs (SLMs) lab.\n\nRemember to adjust your project requirements based on the specific Raspberry Pi model you're using. The Raspi-Zero is great for low-power, space-constrained projects, while the Raspi-4 or 5 models are better suited for more computationally intensive tasks.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":8,"fig-height":6,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["../../../../custom_callout.lua"],"reference-location":"margin","highlight-style":"github","toc":true,"toc-depth":4,"include-in-header":{"text":"<script
