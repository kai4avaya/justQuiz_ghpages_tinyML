The red line represents the serial data received by the bootloader, showing the input bytes being processed. The first three bytes (0x61, 0x52, 0x77) are correct and match the expected password, as indicated by the consistent blue power consumption line. However, upon processing the fourth byte (0x42), a mismatch is detected. The bootloader stops further processing, resulting in a noticeable jump in the blue power consumption line, as the device halts authentication and enters an error state.
